//React’s re-rendering process is based on changes to props or state. When the state of a parent component changes, by default, it re-renders itself and all its child components. However, if a child component is passed as a prop and is not dependent on the parent’s state, it doesn’t need to re-render every time the parent does.

//“This component is separate; it doesn’t need to update with every state change.” So, even though the JSX structure looks the same, the way React treats it is different. It’s like saying, “Here’s a component that I’ve already created; just place it here,” rather than, “Here’s a component that needs to be re-evaluated and potentially re-rendered every time there’s a change.”
